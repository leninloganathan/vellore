# NodeSchool Vellore

Welcome to the NodeSchool Vellore chapter's repository. We use this repository for our website and almost all our communication.

Nodeschool Vellore is just getting started so please get in contact if you would like to help with setup or mentoring. GitHub Issues for this chapter will be used to keep track of all work that needs to be done from ideas, what needs to be done, what's being worked on and what has been resolved.

## Talk to us

We utilise [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/nodeschool/vellore/issues) like a message board and keep almost all of our communication in the open. Feel free to create new issues to make suggestions on how NodeSchool Vellore can improve and grow.

## We are looking for mentors
For the first event here at NodeSchool Vellore we would like to have more mentors. We will be providing your transport costs if you are coming from either Bengaluru or Chennai. 

The event will be taking place at VIT University, Vellore on the 23rd of March. If you are interested please open an issue on this repository and we can discuss further details.
